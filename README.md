# Introduction
This is a program capable of using as much threads as needed, to perform linked list operations.
But what "as needed" means, techically? Simply put, main thread handles requests from users and it wakes as much threads he needs to carry out those requests.

I made this program as a university project, in particular for the "Multicore Parallel Programming" course.
